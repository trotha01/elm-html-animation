# elm-html-animation

A library to simplify creating html animations in elm.  

Try it out!

First have [Elm installed](http://elm-lang.org/install), then

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-html-animation.git
$ cd elm-html-animation/examples
$ elm package install evancz/start-app
$ elm-reactor
```

My focus was to create something I could use as a UI designer to prototype animations quickly, accurately, and without sneaky errors.


Html.Animation supports __Declarative animations__, which tend to be very intuitive. State what the style should be, and it will animate to that style. 

 * __Animations can be smoothly interrupted.  Or chained together.__  

 * __Relative animation__ such as using `add` and `subtract` to animate a property based on its previous value is also available.  Though, be aware that mixing this and animation interruption can lead to unanticipated results.

 * __CSS properties and units are type checked.__ 

 * __Use custom easing__ such as all the lovely functions in [this library](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/Dandandan/Easing/2.0.1/Easing#easing-functions).

 * __Manage multiple animations__ by using the `forwardTo` function.  See _Example 3_.

 * __Infrastructure for more complicated animations__ is provided.  Want to do something like animate a position along a path?  You have the tools to do that.  (If you're curious, you'd start by writing a custom `to` function.)


## The Basics

I recommend checking out [the Elm Architecture](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial/) if you haven't already.  These examples will be much easier if you're already familiar with the standard model, update, and view pattern.  As well you should understand the basics of using the `Effects` library.

So, with all that in mind, here's a basic overview of what you'll need to do to use this library.

To add animations to a module, you'll need to do the following:

  * Store the styling data in your `model`, and define an initial style.

__Note__ all properties that are going to be animated need to be accounted for in the initial style.

```elm
import Html.Animation as UI

type alias Model = { style : UI.Animation }

init : Model
init = { style = 
            UI.init 
                [ UI.Left -350.0 UI.Px
                , UI.Opacity 0.0 
                ]
        }
```

  * Add a new action to your Action type to allow updates to be sent to an animation.

```elm
type Action = Animate UI.Action

-- and in our update function, we need the following code to allow for updates to be passed to an animation

update : Action -> Model -> ( Model, Effects Action )
update action model =
  case action of

    Animate action ->
      let
        (anim, fx) = UI.update action model.style
      in
        ( { model | style = anim }
        , Effects.map Animate fx )
```

  * In your `view`, render the animation as a css style.

```elm

view : Address Action -> Model -> Html
view address model =
          div [ style (UI.render model.style) ] []

```


  * Start creating animations!  Now that we're set up, we can begin animating. 


# Example 1: Showing a Menu on Hover
[demo](https://mdgriffith.github.io/elm-html-animation/examples/SideMenu.html) / [view code](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-html-animation/blob/master/examples/SideMenu.elm)

Our first example is a menu that is shown when the mouse enters a certain area, and hides when the mouse leaves.

So, our first step is to add two values to our Action type, `Show` and `Hide`, and in the update function, we start an animation when those actions occur.  Let's take a look at how we construct an animation.


```elm
-- ... we add this to the case statement in our update function.
    Show ->
      let 
        (anim, fx) = 
              UI.animate 
              -- |> UI.duration (0.5*second)
              -- |> UI.easing (\x -> x)
                 |> UI.props 
                     [ UI.Left (UI.to 0) UI.Px
                     , UI.Opacity (UI.to 1)
                     ] 
                 |> UI.on model.style

      in
        ( { model | style = anim }
        , Effects.map Animate fx )
```

Notice we are programming declaratively by defining what style property should be by using `UI.to`.  

We have the option of defining a duration and an easing function. In the above code, these are commented out, which means the defaults are used.  The default duration is _400ms_, while the default easing is _sinusoidal in-out_.  Make sure to check out this [library](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/Dandandan/Easing/2.0.1/Easing#easing-functions) if you're looking for easing functions.

Finally, we have to `map` the resulting animation Effect, `fx`, to the Animate action we created earlier.

Now that we have this animation, it has a few properties that may not be immediately apparent.  If a `Hide` action is called halfway through execution of the `Show` animation, the animation will be smoothly interrupted. 

However, there may be a situation where we don't want our animation to be interrupted.  Instead we might want the current animation to play out completely and for our new animation to play directly afterwards.  To do this, we would use `UI.queue` instead of `UI.animate`


# Example 2: Chaining Animations
[demo](https://mdgriffith.github.io/elm-html-animation/examples/Chaining.html) / [view code](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-html-animation/blob/master/examples/Chaining.elm)

We also have option of chaining animations together.  So, let's make a square that cycles through a few background colors when you click it.

```elm
-- in our update function:
    ChangeColor ->
      let 
        (anim, fx) = 
            UI.animate 
                    |> UI.props 
                        [ UI.BackgroundColorA 
                              UI.RGBA (UI.to 100) (UI.to 100) (UI.to 100) (UI.to 1.0)  
                        ] 
                |> UI.andThen -- create a new keyframe
                    |> UI.duration (1*second)
                    |> UI.props 
                        [ UI.BackgroundColorA 
                              UI.RGBA (UI.to 178) (UI.to 201) (UI.to 14) (UI.to 1.0) 
                        ] 
                |> UI.andThen 
                    |> UI.props 
                        [ UI.BackgroundColorA 
                              UI.RGBA (UI.to 58) (UI.to 40) (UI.to 69) (UI.to 1.0) 
                        ] 
                |> UI.on model.style 

      in
        ( { model | style = anim }
        , Effects.map Animate fx )

```


In this case we can use `UI.andThen` to create a new key frame.  This new keyframe will have it's own independent duration, easing, and properties.  Again, it can be interrupted at any point.


# Example 3: Managing Multiple Animations
[demo](https://mdgriffith.github.io/elm-html-animation/examples/Showcase.html) / [view code](https://github.com/mdgriffith/elm-html-animation/blob/master/examples/Showcase.elm)

It's also fairly common to have a list of elements that all need to animated individually.  In order to do this we need to make a few changes to our boilerplate code we had in the beginning.


First, our model would be something like this:

```elm

type alias Model = { widgets : List Widget }

type alias Widget = 
          { style : UI.Animation
          }

```


We also need to prepare a function that will perform an animation update on a specific widget in the list.  

To do this, we're going to use `UI.forwardTo`.  Essentially, `UI.forwardTo` will take a list of things and an index, and apply an update to the thing at that index.  In order to do this, it needs a `getter` and a `setter` function to get and set the style of the widget.

```elm

forwardToWidget = UI.forwardTo 
                      .style -- widget style getter
                      (\w style -> { w | style = style }) -- widget style setter
```


Now that we have this function, we can animate a widget by using code like this:
```elm
      -- where i is the index of the widget we want to animate.
      let 
        (widgets, fx) = 
                    UI.animate
                        |> UI.duration (5*second)
                        |> UI.props 
                            [ UI.Opacity (UI.to 0)  
                            ] 
                        |> forwardToWidget i model.widgets

      in
        ( { model | widgets = widgets }
        , Effects.map (Animate i) fx )

```


Because of this change, we also have to slightly change our `Animate` action to include the index of the widget that is being animated.

So, our Animate action gets an Int.

```elm

type Action = Animate Int UI.Action
```

And the update function forwards an animation update to a specific widget using our forwardToWidget.
```elm
    Animate i action ->
      let
        (widgets, fx) = 
            forwardToWidget i model.widgets action 
      in
        ( { model | widgets = widgets }
        , Effects.map (Animate i) fx )

```


From here, we're able to animate each widget independently.



# Notes and Common Pitfalls


## Uninitialized Style Animations

If you attempt to animate a property that hasn't been provided in the initial style, _that property will not be animated._

This was done because it seems to be the better option than animating with an arbitrarily chosen default value and with arbitrarily chosen default units.

So, if a property isn't animating, check your UI.init!


## Doubly Specified Units

If you specify different units for a property in the UI.init vs the animation, _that property animation will also not be animated._

I know this is not the best solution, but there are a few reasons why it's the case.

 1. Html.Animation can't automatically convert between units.  A classic example of why not, would be attempting to convert px to %. This can't be done without querying the DOM.

 2. Again we want to avoid making up arbitrary default values.

I'm currently working on a solution by making units only specified in the UI.init, however this turns out to be fairly complicated (see __eliminating-twice-declared-units__ branch if you're curious and want a headache.)  

So, maybe this will be solved in the future?
